# Musical-Themed Candy Crush

![Game Screenshot](images/game-screenshot.png)

A musical twist on the classic match-3 game!
Match musical instrument symbols to complete level objectives!

**Note:** This is a solo project. Much of the game logic and code was generated with the help of AI (GitHub Copilot), especially the core mechanics and modular structure. The project was originally started by following a YouTube tutorial for a basic match-3 game, then heavily customised and extended with AI assistance.

**AI & Manual Testing:**
While AI was used to accelerate development and modularisation, manual human testing remains essential for catching subtle bugs, ensuring a great user experience, and validating real-world usability. Feedback from human testers are welcome and encouraged!

# How to Play

1. Click **Play Game** to start Level 1.  
   - When you start a new game from the menu, your lives are reset to 5.
2. Match 3 or more of the same musical symbols by swapping adjacent tiles.
3. Complete the level objectives within the move and time limits.
4. The info bar above the game board (showing level, lives, moves, score, timer, and counters) is always visible during play.
5. If you run out of moves or time, you lose a life.
6. When all lives are lost, you are returned to the menu and can restart with 5 lives.
7. The Play button always starts Level 1 and resets all counters and lives.

 Drag or swipe adjacent tiles to create matches

- Match **3** tiles → 10 points
- Match **4** tiles → 20 points
- Match **5** tiles → 40 points
- Match at least 6 tiles - 60 points

This modular structure makes it easy to maintain, test, and extend the game. Each file is responsible for a specific aspect of the game logic or UI.


## Running Unit Tests

1. Install dependencies (if not already):
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev jest
   ```
2. Run all tests:
   ```bash
   npx jest
   ```
3. Add your test cases in the `__tests__` folder for each module.

## Test Coverage

This project uses [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for unit and component testing. Test coverage is automatically generated after running the test suite.

- To generate a coverage report, run:
  ```bash
  npx jest --coverage
  ```
- The HTML coverage report can be found at:
  ```
  coverage/lcov-report/index.html
  ```
- Open this file in your browser to view detailed coverage by file and line.

Aim for high coverage, but focus on meaningful tests for game logic, UI, and edge cases. See the coverage report for areas needing more tests.

# Getting Started


1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hannahro15/Musical-Themed-Candy-Crush.git
   ```

2. Open `index.html` in your web browser
